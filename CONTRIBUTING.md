# Contributing to Jenkins


In the Jenkins project we appreciate any kind of contributions: code, documentation, design, etc.
Any contribution counts, and the size does not matter!
Check out [this page](https://jenkins.io/participate/) for more information and links!

Many plugins and components also define their own contributing guidelines and communication channels. 
There is also a big number of [mailing lists](https://jenkins.io/mailing-lists/) and [chats](https://jenkins.io/chat/).

| WARNING: This is a default CONTRIBUTING page for all repositories in Jenkins. Every plugin/component is its own sub-project which may deviate in its rules. Guidelines and channel links in repository CONTRIBUTING/README pages, if any, take precedence over this page. |
