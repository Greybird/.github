# Contributing to Jenkins

[![Contributing](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributing-guidelines-blue)](https://jenkins.io/participate/)

In the Jenkins project we appreciate any kind of contributions: code, documentation, design, etc.
Any contribution counts, and the size does not matter!
Check out [this page](https://jenkins.io/participate/) for more information and links!

Many plugins and components also define their own contributing guidelines and communication channels. 
There is also a big number of [mailing lists](https://jenkins.io/mailing-lists/) and [chats](https://jenkins.io/chat/).

| WARNING: This is a default CONTRIBUTING page for all repositories in Jenkins. It might be overridden in repositories, and contributing guidelines maybe also defined in other places README. |
