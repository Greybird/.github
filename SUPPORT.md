Getting support for Jenkins
===========================

Jenkins is a community-driven project, and it does not provide user support in the common meaning.
Nevertheless, there is an active community which might be able to help with the issues you experience.
The [Jenkins JIRA](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa) is **NOT** a support site. 
If you need assistance or have general questions, visit us in [chat](https://jenkins.io/chat/), or email one of the user [mailing lists](https://jenkins.io/mailing-lists/).
Also check out the main component's page for specific communication channel references.

Please be aware that most of the Jenkins components are maintained by volunteers. 
This means, there is no guarantee of a timely response or issue resolution.
If you want commercial support for Jenkins,
there are companies which offer it.
See [this Wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Commercial+Support).
